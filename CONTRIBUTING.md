# Contributing to WorldDynamics.jl 

Thank you for considering contributing to the WorldDynamics.jl open source framework! 

Following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.
We will do our best to address your issue, evaluate changes, and help you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously, and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to adhere to the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).

## Getting Started

Contributions to this repo are made via issues and pull requests (PRs). Here are some general guidelines that apply to both:

- Search for existing issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to ensure that issues are handled in a timely manner, but depending on the impact, it may take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help get attention if your issue is being blocked.


### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created. 

If you find an issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. 

### Pull Requests

PRs for our package are always welcome, and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement scheduled for the next release. In general, PRs should

- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Include documentation.
- Be accompanied by a description of the main objective of the PR.

For changes that affect core functionality, or that would require disruptive changes (e.g., a major release), it's best to open an issue first to discuss your proposal. This is not required, but can save time in creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the "fork and pull" Git workflow

1. Fork the repository into your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a local branch with a short but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository.
