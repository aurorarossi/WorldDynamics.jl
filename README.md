An open-source framework written in Julia for world dynamics modeling and simulation.

## The World Dynamics Project

The World Dynamics project aims to provide a modern framework to investigate [models of global dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling) focused on sustainable development based on current software engineering and scientific machine learning techniques. Our group is developing a Julia library to allow scientists to easily use and adapt different world models, from [Meadows et al.'s World3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3) to recent proposals. By enabling an open, interdisciplinary, and consistent comparative approach to scientific model development, our goal is to supply high-quality information to global policy making on environmental and economic issues.
